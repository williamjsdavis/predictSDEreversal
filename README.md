# predictSDEreversal
Attempting to predict the time until a reversal using machine learning techniques.

## Data

Data is previously computed in MATLAB. Data is an integration of an SDE of the form

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?dX_t=f(t)dt&space;&plus;&space;g(x)d\eta_t" title="dX_t=f(t)dt + g(x)d\eta_t" />

where the drift term is

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?f(x)&space;=&space;-\gamma*(|x|&space;-&space;x_0)sgn(x)(1-e^{-|x|/\epsilon})" title="f(x) = -\gamma*(|x| - x_0)sgn(x)(1-e^{-|x|/\epsilon})" />

the noise term is

and the noise process <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\eta" title="\eta" /> is an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with characteristic time <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\theta" title="\theta" />.

These values are fitted through comparison to the paleomagnetic model PADM2M ([Ziegler et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2010.04905.x)). Drift and noise functions are displayed below.

Observed quantity is the amplitude of the axial dipole field. The quantity to be predicted from this is the "time until next polarity reversal".

Statistical features are calculated using a moving window over the ADM.

## Predictions

A random forest method similar to the methodology of [Rouet‚ÄêLeduc et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1002/2017GL074677) is used. Hyperparameters have not been explored or tuned yet.

Preliminary results are not great. I believe this is because there is insufficient information in the SDE integration to accurately predict reversals. Physically richer models may provide the depth of information needed for predictions.
